#Danko-Ipsum - Simple Lorem Ipsum generator
This Angular app was created just for fun during one hot summer evening. It's a simple Lorem Ipsum generator that uses quotes of our "great and beloved" politician Captain Danko. Kpt.Danko Ipsum allows user to chose between multiple types of Lorem Ipsum - number of paragraphs, number of words or number of items in unsorted list.

#Getting Started
Danko Ipsum do not use any database, so you do not need to set-up any connections. Since I collected only around 100 quotes, they are stored locally and provided by qotes service. There is just one thing you should do:
1.	After npm install, please overwrite original bootstrap.css by the one provided in folder "bootstrap_theme".
